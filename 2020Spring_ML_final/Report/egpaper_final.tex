\section{Introduction}

Hidden Markov Model has such a good strength in analysing sequential data, and had been widely used in language model, part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition \cite{ratgo}. Based on Markov process, HMM infers probability distributions of the model from observations and find the most likely results so far. It is useful for cases unable to observe all datasets and only able to get its causal evidences, and can be applied in many different data restoring fields \cite{hmmwiki}, e.g. multiple DNA sequence alignment, protein secondary structure prediction \cite{biology} and speech recognition. Datasets being used in HMM modelling should be time-serial. For example, speech recognition has temporal structure consisted of statistical models and can be encoded as a sequence of spectral vectors spanning the audio frequency range \cite{speechrecognition}.

Likewise, we'd like to use temporal human action sensor data to make Human Action Recognition system (HAR) using HMM. We've trained our model with  Human Activities and Postural Transitions datasets (HAPT) produced by Jorge L, \etal \cite{hapt}. Measurement was done by 30 volunteers carrying a waist-mounted smart phone with embedded inertial sensors. Dataset includes 61 experiments with 30 participants and measured in 50Hz frequency and about 400s duration per experiment. Each experiment contains 12 types of human actions like standing, walking down, \etc. We separated into 12 part of data so we can easily train our model by action type. Eventually, we've got 1,214 examples and randomly split as train and test dataset as 9:1 ratio respectively.

Our goal is to recognize characters from the captcha image.
Each captcha image has a variable length of characters. 
Considering length while training through deep neural networks will be significant works.

We've trained our network with 10,000 training examples whose lengths vary from 2 to 5 and tested with 1,000 test images of length 2 to 7.

While several experiments, we've found the best set of hyper-parameters that make our model perform more accurately and even faster.

\section{Related Works}
Human activity recognition is nowadays an active research field which aims to understand human behaviour and there have been lots of researches to figure out human behaviours. One of the approaches was method consisted of support vector machines (SVMs) and temporal filters of activity probability estimations within a limited time window \cite{haptpaper}. Probability estimation after feature extraction was done by MAP filtering.

Rubén San-Segundo, \etal have implemented system comprising of three main modules: feature extraction, HMMs training and activity recognition. In the training module, 6 HMM modules were being trained to classify human actions with datasets of only six different physical activity types: walking, walking-upstairs, walking-downstairs, sitting, standing and lying down. Due to the lack amount of activity types they've obtained the recognition error rate of 2.5\% \cite{monitoring}.

\section{Preliminaries}

\subsection{Hidden Markov Model}


A hidden Markov model (HMM) allows us to talk about both observed events (like words that we see in the input) and hidden events (like part-of-speech tags) that we think of as causal factors in our probabilistic model. HMM model $\lambda$ contains transition probability matrix $A$, a set of state variables $X$, a sequence of observations $O$, emission probabilities $B$, and an initial probability distribution over states $\pi$.

We can characterize HMM into 3 fundamental problems;

1) Likelihood: given the model $\lambda$, find likelihood $P(O|\lambda)$ whether the observation $O$ is a probable sequence based on $\lambda$.

2) Decoding: given an observation sequence $O$ and an model $\lambda$, discover the best hidden state sequence $X$.

3) Learning: given an observation sequence $O$ and the set of states in $\lambda$, learn the parameters $A$ and $B$.

\subsection{Forward Algorithm}

%\begin{center}

%\end{center}

We use algorithm called the forward algorithm to compute likelihood of observed events. It is an algorithm that uses a table to store intermediate values as it builds up the probability of the observation sequence. The forward algorithm computes the observation probability by summing over the probabilities of all possible hidden state paths that could generate the observation sequence \cite{hmm}.

\subsection{Baum-Welch Algorithm}
The standard algorithm for HMM training is the forward-backward, or Baum-Welch algorithm, a special case of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm (EM). The algorithm will let us train both the transition probabilities $A$ and the emission probabilities $B$ of model $\lambda$.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Proposed Method}
This section describes overall flows of our proposed method, \texttt{jerk8vel8iter50}. Feature extraction and learning with multinomial HMM are the key concepts of our model.

\subsection{Feature extraction}
Since HAR datasets are given as 3 dimensional vector sets, we have to figure out what feature metric would describe our hidden states of model. We'd like to transform 3 dimensional vectors of acceleration and angular speed into a single metric, so we can train these observations to our HMM model. Figure below shows how we can classify vectors into 8 spaces, A to H, and in number, 0 to 7 \wrt.


From acceleration observation data, we can apparently determine the direction of jerk, time derivative of acceleration by subtracting neighbouring values \cite{jerkwiki}.


Inferring from the name of our proposed model \texttt{jerk8vel8iter50}, it has 8 jerk states and 8 of those in angular velocity, which is simply determined by signs of vector coordinates. Feature metric is only the measure multiply with these two. For instances, if signs of jerk and angular velocity are $(+,-,+)$ and $(-,-,+)$ each, the measure will be 20 because the state of jerk would be 4(E) and that of angular velocity would be 5(F).

\subsection{Multinomial HMM}
Using model selection package in sklearn \cite{sklearn}, original set was split into train and test data. Every data entity has its feature metric which will be the observation input to HMM model $\lambda$. We differentiated into 12 models by activity types and each model learns corresponding activity and classifies test data set with one vs rest method (OVR) with maximum likelihood. \texttt{jerk8vel8iter50} was trained with maximum iterations of 50.

As observation values are all in discrete number, Multinomial HMM from \textit{hmmlearn} was selected and values of hyper-parameters were determined through various empirical approaches. We've finally got \texttt{jerk8vel8iter50} model with 92.62\% as test accuracy and 24623.64s as total training time. Figures below show a table of 12 models' training time, and some of examples when estimates went wrong. 9 misclassified actions out of 122 examples were detected and plotted how does these pairs differ in state sequences.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Empirical Analysis}

Here we describes how we came up with \texttt{jerk8vel8iter50} model. And this is the table of comparison in 1-iteration trained models in aspect of test accuracy.

\begin{tabular}{ p{3cm}| ccc | c}
 \hline
 Model Name & jerk $j$ & acc $a$ & vel $\alpha$ & Accuracy \\
 \hline
 \texttt{jerk8} & \OK & & & 50.81\% \\
 \texttt{acc8} & & \OK & & 35.24\% \\
 \texttt{vel8} & & & \OK & 60.65\% \\
 \texttt{acc8vel8} & & \OK & \OK & 78.68\% \\
 \texttt{jerk8acc8} & \OK & \OK & & 40.16\% \\
 \texttt{jerk2vel8} & \OK & & \OK & 63.93\% \\
 \texttt{jerk4vel8} & \OK & & \OK & 79.50\% \\
 \texttt{\textbf{jerk8vel8}} & \BOLDOK & & \BOLDOK & \textbf{84.42\%} \\
 \texttt{jerk8acc2vel8} & \OK & \OK & \OK & 63.11\% \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
}

\subsection{Feature Metric Approach}
When deciding what feature metric would be suitable, we've compared many different models trained for 1 iteration and chose the metric of the model with best test accuracy. From the table above, we've found angular velocity data measured from gyro sensor and jerk data were the significant classifiers in this approach. In conclusion, using \texttt{jerk8vel8} model was the best.

\subsection{Model Complexity Approach}
When we construct HMM model with too many states, there can be over-fitting issues that our model only estimates trained data accurately but not test data. By differing number of observation states, we've found out the model having the best complexity would also be \texttt{jerk8vel8}.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Conclusion}
Understanding human behaviour using sensor models needs temporally learning models since the dataset is also time-serial. Many other works determining human action recognition uses RNN models like LSTM, probabilistic models like particle filter or in hybrid. We've constructed HMM model simply learning the observation patterns from HAR dataset produced by Jorge L, \etal.

Dataset includes 1,214 instances of 12 human actions and provides acceleration and angular velocity vectors. Feature extraction in acceleration and angular velocity vector was to splitting its direction into 8 sections, numbered them and use to define observation states. With empirical approaches, we've figured out \texttt{jerk8vel8} having appropriate model complexity and high test accuracy as well.

We've trained this model with maximum training iteration of 50 and \texttt{jerk8vel8iter50} showed remarkable performance of 92.62\% as the test accuracy and 24623.64s as the training time. In future works, we'll improve our model with numerous instances created from more experiments and use other additional sensors to extract various states features.
